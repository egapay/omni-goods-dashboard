            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
              Omni-Good Solutions is a fictional company I created in order to
              simulate the sales data of an actual company. The company consists
              of shipping out supplies to their customers all across the USA.
              The products range from technology, furniture, and office
              supplies.

            <h2>Project Objective</h2>
            <p>
              I took on the role as <b>Data Analyst</b> for Omni-Good Solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My manager asked me to create an exploratory dashboard answering
              the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>What was our total sales number for this year</b>: Analyze
                the total sales numbers for each region, category, and month.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>What was our top and bottom selling products?</b>: Evaluating
                the top movers can help ensure that particular item stays in
                stock. The bottom movers can be further assessed to determine
                their value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>How did we perform in comparsion to last year?</b>: Compare
                the year-over-year % and month-over-month % changes to
                understand how each region performed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Which states were we selling the most products?</b>:
                Investigate which states had the most sales to help ensure
                on-time shipping to those customers.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </section>

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>
              For this dashboard, I used a sample dataset of orders related to
              company's products being placed by customers across the USA. The
              data contains orders from <b>January 2014</b> to
              <b>January 2018</b>, containing almost <b>10,000 rows</b>. The
              orders included information such as order date, customer name,
              location, category, sales, and profit.
