            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
              Omni-Good Solutions is a fictional company I created in order to
              simulate the sales data of an actual company. The company consists
              of shipping out supplies to their customers all across the USA.
              The products range from technology, furniture, and office
              supplies.

            <h2>Project Objective</h2>
            <p>
              I took on the role as <b>Data Analyst</b> for Omni-Good Solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My manager asked me to create an exploratory dashboard with the
              following objectives:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>What was our total sales number for this year?</li>
              <li>*What was our total sales for each category?</li>
              <li>*What was our total sales per month?</li>
              <li>What was our top and bottom selling products?</li>
              <li>What was the year-over-year change?</li>
              <li>What was our month-over-month % sales change by category?</li>
              <li>*What was the month-over-month change?</li>
              <li>Which states were we selling the most products?</li>
              combine asterisked items and explain it further in the insights.
            </ol>
